## 📖 Project Overview

**Traces of Twins** is a 3D story-driven mystery game optimized for PC and mobile platforms. The player takes on the role of a detective, solving a complex case involving missing twins through exploration, evidence collection, and logic puzzles.

As the **Team Lead** and **Lead Developer**, I directed the entire creative and technical process; from designing minigame mechanics to engineering the core systems that bring the story to life.

## 🎮 Key Features

* **Immersive Investigation:** A complete detective loop including **DNA collection, fingerprint analysis, and evidence placement**.
* **Diverse Minigames:** Over 10 unique minigames (Lockpicking, Wiring, Hacking, Simon Says) designed for touch and mouse interaction.
* **Mobile & PC Optimization:** High-fidelity 3D environments optimized using **Occlusion Culling** and **Canvas-based Interaction**.
* **Narrative Systems:** A dynamic dialogue and quest system that guides the player through a linear mystery.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Engineering & Design Leadership

I was responsible for the **Entire Unity Implementation** and **Game Design Direction**, ensuring art assets served the gameplay mechanics efficiently.

### 🏗️ System Architecture & Optimization
* **Canvas-Based Minigames:** To maximize performance, I architected all minigames to run entirely on the **Unity UI (Canvas)** system rather than using 3D physics. This significantly reduced draw calls and physics overhead.
* **Event-Driven Design:** Architected the core game loop using **C# Events** to decouple the UI, Inventory, and Quest systems.
* **Interaction Framework:** Developed a modular interaction system allowing seamless switching between 3D exploration and 2D puzzle interfaces.

### ✍️ Narrative & Level Design
* **Narrative Direction:** While the core script was written by an external writer, I designed the **Narrative Flow**, wrote all **In-Game Dialogues**, and implemented the branching logic.
* **Level Design:** Built the entire world layout in Unity, ensuring the environment supported the investigation loop.
* **Design Leadership:** Defined the mechanics and logic for all minigames, directing the art team on the visual requirements and UX flow.

### 🎨 Technical Art & Asset Creation
* **Environment Art:** Personally **modeled and textured the Police Station** environment using Blender, ensuring it fit the performance budget.
* **UI Assets:** Created high-quality icons for collectible items by setting up **render scenes in Blender**, bridging the gap between 3D assets and 2D UI.
* **Lighting & Atmosphere:** Baked lighting maps and configured real-time shadows to achieve a "Noir" atmosphere.
* **Animation Rigging:** Handled NPC rigging and animation blending using **Mixamo** and Unity's Animator State Machines.
